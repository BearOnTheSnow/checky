Checksums to files are what fingerprints are to humans👩🏼👨🏼👧🏼👦🏼👵🏼👴🏼 and tongueprints to dogs🐕! They carry the file's integrity. Often ignored, they are important to keep your system and your files secure.

Checksums are often long to read and even harder to compare. With Checky you can easily comapare long checksums and check the integrity of your downloaded and transferred files.

<h4> How does this work? </h4>
The programme converts your input to lowercase and compare the long checksums. It will output whether the file is damaged or not. Simple as that.<br/>
<h4> What to do? </h4>
